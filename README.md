# My Portfolio
A collection of software projects developed on my own time.

I thought I put together a quick list of the projects I've done on GitHub and make it easier for you to find something interesting. 

I'm a senior software engineer and have worked for Intel and WE Communications ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-garrison/)). As such, most of my development as been for enterprise applications and not something I can share. However, there are aspects of my work that are not propriety and I'm making an effort now to spend more time on sharing work that I've done.

## Python

Here are some projects I've been working:

*  [Build Lights](https://github.com/jb1t/Python/tree/master/buildlights) - this project was created to motivate our development team to fix broken builds and it was a HUGE success. The code queries TeamCity build server and gets the status of all the projects and if there is a broken build it lights a red LED and if all the builds are successful then a green LED. You can read more on my blog [here](http://thefullstacknerd.com/2017/12/15/build-lights/).
*  [Motion Detect](https://github.com/jb1t/Python/tree/master/motiondetect) - is a project that has agumented my home security solution using a Passive Infrared motion sensor. I get notifications when someone comes up to my front door. More on my [blog](http://thefullstacknerd.com/2017/12/08/motion-detection/).

## R
Here I started taking courses on Coursera to learn more about data analytics and data science.

* These scripts are primarily for [academia](https://github.com/jb1t/R/tree/master/coursera).  
* Here is another [example](https://github.com/jb1t/ExData_Plotting1) for the course.

I did apply my learnings and even took it quite a bit further, by building a PowerBI dashboard for my employer that looked at the volume of coverage and applied a time-series decomposition AND an IQR (Interquartile Range) algorithm to get the "spikes" of coverage we were consuming. This highlighted when something of interest (e.g. a trending tweet or topic on the internet) was emerging. 

## C# #

Most of my career has been built using Microsoft technologies. I've developed in SQL server and ASP, ASP.NET, C#, EF, WebAPI, etc... for almost 20 years. Unfortunately I at this time I don't have anything to show for it. So, my plan is to spend time in the next couple of weeks to get this section filed out with some examples of my work (obfuscated) and/or creating new side projects to show my expertise.


## Ardunio

I've been dabbling in my spare time with home electronics projects and I've used the ardunio for more of the real-time serious projects.

* The first project I did with an ardunio was my [automated cat food feeder](https://github.com/jb1t/Arduino/tree/master/catfeeder).
* [LED Game](https://github.com/jb1t/Arduino/tree/master/led_game)
